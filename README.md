# Can Part-of-Speech Embeddings Help Us Identify Generative AI Text?

Project in the course Advanced Natural Language Processing @ IT University of Copenhagen.

We use real posts on Reddit and a generative AI model (LLaMA) to generate human and AI-generated texts. With part-of-speech tagging and a simple LSTM architecture, we attempt at creating a generative AI text discriminator. For the main experimental code, see the branch "hyp-tuning".
